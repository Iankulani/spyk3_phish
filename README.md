# spyk3_phish

spyk3_phish is a conceptual security education tool designed to demonstrate how modern chat platforms can be abused for remote command and control (C2) and social engineering attacks.
Its sole educational purpose is to help cybersecurity students, blue teams, and ethical red teamers understand real-world adversarial techniques so they can better defend against them. The tool simulates how an attacker—after gaining initial access—might establish persistent, low-visibility communication channels using everyday messaging apps.

# Core Capabilities (Simulated for Training)

Multi-Platform Command Firing
spyk3_phish can be configured to send and receive commands through: Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, Slack, iMessage, and Google Chat. In a training lab, a defender watches how an attacker could issue commands like screenshot, keylog_start, enumerate_users, or download_file via encrypted chat messages, blending malicious traffic with legitimate conversations. This teaches why organizations must monitor API logs and bot behaviors, not just email gateways.

# Social Engineering Module

The tool includes pre-built templates for credential harvesting, fake IT support lures, and urgency-based messages tailored to each platform. For example, a Discord bot might ask for a “verification token,” while a WhatsApp message impersonates a delivery service. In training, students learn to spot subtle anomalies—such as mismatched sender IDs, unusual link domains, or out-of-band requests—and practice creating effective user awareness campaigns.

# Stealth & Persistence Simulation

spyk3_phish shows how an adversary could delete command messages after execution, use reactions (e.g., ✅/❌) as acknowledgment signals, and rotate chat threads to avoid detection. Trainees learn to set up alerting rules for unexpected bot additions to group chats, mass @mentions, or repeated small payload deliveries.

# Educational Use Cases

* Red team exercises: Safely demonstrate a chat-based C2 channel without deploying malware on production systems.

* Blue team drills: Analyze chat platform logs to reconstruct an attack timeline, identify IOCs (e.g., user agents, callback patterns), and write detection rules.

* Policy development: Show why organizations need separate “approved bot” registries and why personal messaging apps should be restricted on work devices.

# Important Ethical & Legal Warning

spyk3_phike (as described) is a hypothetical educational construct. Deploying such capabilities without explicit written authorization from the system owner violates computer fraud laws (e.g., CFAA in the U.S., similar statutes worldwide) and platform terms of service. This description is provided solely to advance defensive security knowledge. Always use isolated lab environments with no connection to real user data.

Why Understanding This Matters
Modern attackers increasingly move to collaboration tools because they bypass traditional email security. By studying tools like spyk3_phish in a classroom or CTF setting, defenders learn to

* Monitor chat platform audit logs for unusual command patterns

* Implement behavior-based detection (e.g., a Slack bot that suddenly runs whoami)

* Train users to report any unsolicited chat-based requests for credentials or code execution.# How to clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Iankulani/spyk3_phish.git
cd spyk3_phish
```

# How to run

```bash
python spyk3_phish.py
```


# Conclusion
spyk3_phish is a powerful reminder that security awareness must extend beyond email. When studied ethically, it transforms from a theoretical threat into a practical lesson in detection, response, and resilient system design.
